# BloodBankManagementSystem
Project contains information through database on potential blood donors, patients, and facilities. ID numbers for donors, patients, and facilities are primary. Datasets for each for both donors and patients are listed by ID number, name, birthday, gender, age, phone number, email, address, city, state, zip code, blood type, weight, body temperature, blood pressure, and type of transfusion. The difference between the patient's and donor's transfusion type is that the patient make a request for the type of transfusion they need. The donor just has to meet the standard. Datasets for blood bank facilities are listed by ID number, name, address, contact, and ID number for donor and patient. If the facility has the ID number of a donor and patient on their database, both the donor and the patient must arrive at the specific location whenever an appointment is made.
